#### About Me ####

Hi There! :wave:

I'm an aspiring software developer from NY, currently in GA. When I'm not working or parenting, I'm trying to learn new things...like C#. You can catch me outside (how 'bout that?) pretending to do fitness or watching sports. 

If you want to watch me stumble my way through learning all things tech, follow for more.
